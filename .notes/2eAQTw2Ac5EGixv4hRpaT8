It's an interesting behavior, this "notes within notes"
format enables. You really can just create
notes that spiral down forever.

It's interesting because there's implicit back links.

As soon as you create a note from a note marker,
the system knows exactly where to find any
file that links to it. 

I'm not sure if this is currently the behavior, but, 
for instance, if we put the same note marker in multiple files,
then "Reveal" should show an overview of files that contain it
_and_ / _or_ cycle through the files or cycle through 
"peeks".

By leveraging the rixfeed ux, we could even show
matches in the infinite scrolling list format.
