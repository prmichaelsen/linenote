It seems like some buggy behavior I've been 
experiencing may be on account of not cleaning up 
the cache.

I've been running into instances where saving a file
after deleting a note would cause it to delete
one extra line on save. I think this is because
of some logic I have in one of the on saves
for checking if a note was manually deleted.
Perhaps the cache is being hit twice for
the same "removal" operation.

I've also noticed the cleaning up of orphans in
the background can kill files you're working on.

It should not sweep any editors that are "dirty".
