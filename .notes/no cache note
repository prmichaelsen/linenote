I had a prior implementation that loaded the value once
from the config.

But I decided that's overkill so we just read it every time
and hope that it's a fast read.

Otherwise it's lame you have to reload the window
to see your config changes.


Example of previous code:
```typescript
let removeText: string;
export const getRemoveText = () => {
  if (!removeText) {
    removeText = vscode.workspace
      .getConfiguration()
      .get<string>('linenoteplus.removeText')!;
  }
  return removeText;
}
```
