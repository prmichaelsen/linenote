### Do we need to clean up cache?

The goal of this cache was to keep an 
in memory model of the notes in a way that
mirrors the file structure and contents.

Deleting from the cache seemed to make sense
when I first wrote this.

But I can think of cases where you might
want to hold onto them for a little while:
in the case of moving notes to a "trash"
or supporting an "undo trash note".

Or perhaps to just keep an eye on files
that were being refactored and maybe
a note was intermittenlty lost

The only caveat is how do we avoid
growing our notes infinitely? 

I don't think that will be an issue
at this point or any time in the near future.
