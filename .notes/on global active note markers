### globalActiveNote Markers

`getNoteCache` is a serializable cache of the 
current notes structure. If you need to include properties
that are not serializable, use a separate utility class,

That said, be sure to include props you want to serialize
on the `Note` itself. 

### TODO

I need a trash mechanism. Notes should go to trash first
if they were deleted or unlinked. Pasting the marker
into the same or another file should revive the note
rather than creating a new blank one.
